# git-blog

[WIP](https://pfernandez.github.io/git-blog/)

A blogging platform that runs entirely in Github. Create and publish posts in [Markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/), change the appearance and logic with CSS and JavaScript, and of course keep a revision history of everything, all right in your Github repo.
